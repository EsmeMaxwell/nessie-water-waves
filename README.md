Numerical tools to calculate dispersion relations and such like

20190503 - THIS IS CURRENT DEVELOPMENT CODE -- IT _WILL_ CHANGE!  You have been warned.  Documentation and general cleaning-up coming soon!

--------

MATLAB library to calcaulte dispersion relations and other water wave properties.

For solving Rayleigh instability equation with free-surface boundary (dispersion relations for free surface waves), implements:

- Optimised approximation schemes (Kirby & Chen and Ellingsen & Li)
- A collocation method
- A path-following method
- Calculate pseudospectra for a given shear profile
- Some statistical simulations
